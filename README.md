# A Practical Guide to Optimization under Uncertainty-- Under development
Optimization under Uncertainty has lots of used cases in many real world and practical problems in the area of supply chain, transportation, retail and finance. However, current available resources provide limited help to industry practitioners. If you look at some online resources on Two-stage Stochastic Programming, Dynamic Programming and Robust Optimization, you see they get too technical too soon which puts a burden on their applicability. In this guide, I'm trying to provide a simple tutorial on how to solve optimization problems (mainly linear and mixed integer linear programming) when we face some uncertainty. I give a simple practical example and show how one can formulate that problem in the presence of uncertainty, provide useful algorithms and present sample codes in Python for reference.

## Modeling Uncetainty

### Mean value, Worst case and Best case optomization
### Chance Constrained Optimization
### Recourse Models
#### Two-stage Models
#### Multi-stage Models
Nonanticipativity
### Dynamic Programming

## Optimization Algorithms
Here we provide some helpful algorithms that come handy when dealing with optimization under uncertainty.
### Benderâ€™s Decomposition
### Lagrangian Relaxation
